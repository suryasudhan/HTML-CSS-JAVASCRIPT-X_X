      <h1>Where Stone Meets the Roar of the Sea</h1>
      <p>
        Towering cliffs stand firm against relentless waves, wrapped in drifting
        mist and ancient silence. The ocean crashes below with quiet fury,
        carving stories into stone. It’s a place where time slows, nature speaks
        loud, and raw beauty reminds you who’s really in control.
